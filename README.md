# Deis Workflow Manager Service API

The Workflow Manager Service API is responsible for interfacing with Deis Workflow data. It is a golang https implementation that speaks JSON. The API is the source of authority for the following:

* metadata about unique Deis clusters that have checked in: which components are installed at the time of check-in, and which versions
* current stable version for each Deis cluster component

Additionally, the API is the official interface for accepting Workflow Manager data, e.g.:

* Deis cluster component version CRUD operations
  * i.e., centrally store latest stable version information for all Deis cluster components
* Deis unique cluster anonymous registration
  * i.e., receive Deis Workflow Manager client usage statistics
