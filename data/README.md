# API Persistent Data Architecture

The Workflow Manager Service API stores persistent data via an AWS RDS+postgres instance. We use the [AWS SDK for go](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/wiki) to connect to the RDS service.

## Prerequisites

* Environment-aware AWS configuration (e.g., runtime access to working `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables)
* Existing RDS instance using the `PostgreSQL 9.4.5` engine

## Bootstrapping

The `data` package is designed to bootstrap from scratch a working (empty) table schema if one does not exist, or to use an existing implementation. This is currently a one-time operation that happens at application launch time.

## Table Schemas

Data is organized into three tables, with fields outlined below:

* `clusters`, a table that stores "Cluster" records (each cluster record maps to a unique deis cluster seen in the wild)
  * `cluster_id uuid PRIMARY KEY`
  * `first_seen timestamp`
  * `last_seen timestamp DEFAULT current_timestamp`
  * `data json`
* `clusters_checkins`, a table that stores records of deis clusters checking in with the API
  * `checkins_id bigserial PRIMARY KEY`
  * `cluster_id uuid`
  * `created_at timestamp`
  * `data json`
  * with a uniqueness constraint `unique (cluster_id, created_at)`
* `versions`, a table that stores authoritative deis component version information
  * `component_name varchar(64) PRIMARY KEY`
  * `last_updated timestamp`
  * `data json`
